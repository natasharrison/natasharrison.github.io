# Natasha Harrison Portfolio

## Description 

This project is a portfolio website used to showcase future projects and work I've done to other developers as well as potential employers. 

I want this site to be a snapshot of my personality and work. 

This is a working portfolio so new content will be added as it is developed. 

I've faced challenges with the hero image as well as formatting the contact info section to be responsive. I've added these to the 'future task' list below. 

Any and all feedback from users is appreciated!

## Future Tasks

- [ ] reformat links within nav bar to take user to top of the section instead of middle
